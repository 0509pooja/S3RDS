# AWS Lambda & Docker CI/CD Pipeline for S3 to RDS/Glue ETL

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, and AWS services to automate an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. The system reads data from an S3 bucket, pushes it to an RDS database, and if that fails, pushes the data to an AWS Glue database. The process is containerized using Docker, and AWS Lambda is utilized for running the tasks.

The following steps outline the key tasks covered in this project:

### Task Breakdown:
1. **GitHub Repository Setup**: Created a GitHub repository to store the code, Dockerfile, and Terraform scripts.
2. **Docker File**: Developed a Dockerfile to create a Docker image that performs the following:
   - Reads data from an S3 bucket.
   - Pushes the data to an RDS instance (if possible).
   - If RDS push fails, pushes the data to a Glue Database.
3. **Deploy Docker Image to AWS ECR**: The Docker image was created and deployed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
4. **AWS Lambda Function**: Created a Lambda function using the Docker image and tested the function to ensure it works properly.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins**: Implemented a Jenkins pipeline to automate the code deployment process and resource creation using Terraform.
6. **Terraform**: Utilized Terraform to provision the necessary AWS resources, including the S3 bucket, RDS, Glue database, and Lambda function.
7. **Documentation**: Screenshots of the Jenkins output, Terraform resource creation, and Lambda function execution are included in this repository.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Dockerfile Creation
The Dockerfile includes the code for reading data from an S3 bucket and pushing it to RDS or Glue Database based on the success/failure of the RDS connection. The Python script for the operations (`app.py`) is included.

Here’s a sample `Dockerfile` snippet:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt

# Add your Python app code
COPY app.py /app/

WORKDIR /app

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

The `app.py` contains the logic for:
- Fetching data from S3.
- Pushing data to RDS.
- Pushing data to Glue if RDS is unavailable.

### 2. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
The Jenkins pipeline automates the process of building the Docker image, pushing it to ECR, and deploying the application. The `Jenkinsfile` in this repository defines the steps for the pipeline:

- **Build Docker Image**: Jenkins will build the image based on the `Dockerfile`.
- **Push Docker Image to ECR**: The Docker image is pushed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
- **Deploy Lambda**: Jenkins deploys the Lambda function using the created Docker image.

### 3. Terraform Configuration
Terraform scripts in the `terraform/` folder are used to create the following AWS resources:
- **S3 Bucket**: For storing input data.
- **RDS**: For storing processed data (if applicable).
- **Glue Database**: For fallback storage when RDS is not available.
- **Lambda Function**: For running the ETL process.
- **IAM Roles and Permissions**: For secure access between the resources.

To deploy the resources:
1. Configure AWS CLI with your credentials.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
3. Run `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure.

### 4. Lambda Function Deployment
The Lambda function is triggered by the events from S3, using the Docker image created earlier. The function is managed through the AWS Management Console.

### 5. Screenshots
All the necessary output windows from Jenkins, Terraform, and Lambda are included in the `screenshots/` folder.

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

### 2. Build Docker Image and Push to ECR:
- Follow the Jenkins pipeline to automate this process.
- Alternatively, you can manually build the Docker image and push it to ECR using AWS CLI commands.

### 3. Apply Terraform Configuration:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 4. Trigger Lambda Function:
Once the AWS resources are set up, you can trigger the Lambda function by uploading a file to the S3 bucket or through the Lambda test mechanism in AWS Console.

## Notes
- **Jenkins**: Jenkins is used for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Terraform**: Terraform is used for provisioning AWS resources.
- **Docker**: Docker is used for containerizing the Python application.
- **AWS Services**: The project uses S3, RDS, Glue, Lambda, and IAM services.
